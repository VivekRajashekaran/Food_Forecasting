# Food_Forecasting
Overview

This project focuses on developing a forecasting model to predict food demand. Accurate demand forecasting is crucial for reducing food waste, optimizing inventory management, and ensuring timely delivery in businesses such as cloud kitchens and catering services.

Objectives

Analyze historical food demand data to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies.

Preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies.

Build predictive models to forecast future food demand.

Evaluate the models and select the best-performing one based on accuracy and reliability metrics.

Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical summaries to understand the data.

Data Preprocessing: Techniques to clean, normalize, and transform the dataset for modeling.

Model Development: Implementation of machine learning models for time series forecasting or regression analysis.

Model Evaluation: Metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE to assess model performance.

Prerequisites

To run this project, you need:

Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and potentially statsmodels or tensorflow for advanced models.

Files

food_forecasting.ipynb: The main notebook containing code for EDA, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

Datasets: Include the historical demand data in CSV format (if not embedded).
